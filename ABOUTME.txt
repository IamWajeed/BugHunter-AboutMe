I am Wajeed Jamiu, hailed from the ancient city of Ibadan, South-west Nigeria. Going by my training, I am a Town Planner, 
and also a Spatial analyst - certified Geographic Information System professional. I am a registered member of Nigerian Institute of Management,
Nigerian Institute of Town Planners, and also Town Planners Registration Council of Nigeria. This attests to my right to practice as a
chartered and licenced town planner in Nigeria. 

Interestingly, I have also gathered years of professional work experience in customer service, sales and construction, all which has enhanced 
my analytical etiquette and professional ethics. Being a Data enthusiast however, I have developed a strong interest in the data analytics 
ecosystem and as a means of solving problems and drawing insight for businesses.  

Without missing words, a combination of my background, experience and interests has reflected in my desire to explore the deployment of 
Information and technolgical tools in solving global issues. This has took a new turn, thus taking me on a career journey of being trained, 
mentored and master the tenets of software testing and automation engineering.
